## Goals of this in-class activity:

- Getting you even more accustomed to using `ggplot2`.

## Notes:

* When creating your graphs, consider context (i.e. axis labels, title, ...)!
* If I provide partially completed code, I will put `eval = FALSE` in the chunk.  Make sure to change that to `eval = TRUE` once you have completed the code in the chunk.
* Be prepared to ask for help from me, Tory, and your classmates!  We scratch the surface of `ggplot2` in class.  But I encourage you to really dig in and make your graphs your own (i.e. don't rely on defaults).

### Problem 1: US counties 

The following questions use the county dataset in the `openintro` package. You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation with ?county and you can also find this information here.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(openintro)
data(county)
```

a. What does the following code do? Does it work? Does it make sense? Why/why not?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(county) +
  geom_point(aes(x = median_edu, y = median_hh_income)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = smoking_ban, y = pop2017))
```


b. Which of the following two plots makes it easier to compare poverty levels (`poverty`) across people from different median education levels (`median_edu`)? What does this say about when to place a faceting variable across rows or columns?

```{r}
ggplot(county %>% filter(!is.na(median_edu))) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = homeownership, y = poverty)) + 
  facet_grid(median_edu ~ .)
```
```{r}
ggplot(county %>% filter(!is.na(median_edu))) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = homeownership, y = poverty)) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ median_edu)
```

c. Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs. Note that wherever a categorical variable is used in the plot, it’s metro.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
ggplot(county %>% filter(!is.na(median_edu))) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = homeownership, y = poverty, color = str_to_title(metro))) + 
  facet_grid(str_to_title(median_edu) ~ .) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "D", begin = 0.2, end = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Poverty and homeownership by education level", 
       x = "Homeownership", y = "Poverty", color = "Metro")
```

### Problem 2: Napoleon's March

The instructions for this exercise are simple: recreate the Napoleon’s march plot by **Charles John Minard** in `ggplot2`. 

```{r, out.width='85%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('../img/Minard.png')
```

**Edward Tufte** has said that Minard's plot "may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn" because it manages to pack a ton of information into one dense figure. The plot contains six variables, each mapped to a different aesthetic:

| Information                           | Aesthetic       |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Size of Napoleon's Grande Armée       | Width of path   |
| Longitude of the army's position      | x-axis          |
| Latitude of the army's position       | y-axis          |
| Direction of the army's movement      | Color of path   |
| Date of points along retreat path     | Text below plot |
| Temperature during the army's retreat | Line below plot |

The data is provided as three separate text documents: cities, temperatures, and troops.

#### Getting Started

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggmap)
library(ggrepel)
library(gridExtra)
library(pander)

cities <- read.table("../data/minard/cities.txt",
                     header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

troops <- read.table("../data/minard/troops.txt",
                     header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

temps <- read.table("../data/minard/temps.txt",
                    header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(date = dmy(date))  # Convert string to actual date

```

The troops data includes five variables about troop movement: location, number of survivors, direction (advancing or retreating) and group (since Napoleon had generals commanding different elements of the army). 

```{r troops-head, results="asis"}
troops %>% head() %>% pandoc.table(style = "rmarkdown")
```

Each of these variables maps well into ggplot's aesthetic-based paradigm. If we include just geographic and group information (so there are separate lines for the different divisions), we get a basic skeleton of the original plot:

```{r troops-1, fig.width=10, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(troops, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_path()
```

Searching for "Napoleon’s march in ggplot2" online will yield many resources to recreate the visualization using `ggplot2`. This activity involves using these online resources while citing them correctly. The goals are: (1) to navigate and reference web materials, (2) to understand and replicate `ggplot2` code, (3) to explain the code's function in your words, and (4) to add your personal touch to the final output. Here's what to focus on:

- Cite resources used, including those you read or get code snippets from. A list with links and a brief usage summary is sufficient.

- Explain your code's workings in your own words, rather than interpreting the visualization.

- Personalize your visualization, like altering colors or labels, to resemble the original more closely. Highlight what changes you made and why.
